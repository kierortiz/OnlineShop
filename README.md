# this project is collaborated with 2 other students during my time in college
this project is titled "An Online Ordering or Reservations and Inventory Management System for Blessed 4J's Grocery Store"

this system is mainly HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL as the database and PHPmyadmin as the interface.

The purpose of this website is for consumers to view and order groceries online and or for them to be able to reserve said groceries with 10% downpayment requirement if they chose to reserve the groceries. For the admin side of this website, inventory can be tracked and monitored in realtime and it will reflect on the website if a specific item is low in quantity or out of stock. It also has logs for tracking orders and reservations.

The limitations of this website is it doesn't verify payments on the website, the vendor uses GCash(A 3rd party app) to verify payments.
